You can view the world in a realtime map using the [map](http://minecraft.poweredbyjeff.com) button at the top of the page. We also have a Facebook group, contact an Arbiter in-game for an invite.

## Connecting to the server

Server Name: Powered By Jeff
Server Address: minecraft.poweredbyjeff.com

Recommended texture packs for use on our server:
- [Life HD - v81 128x (download)](LIFE128x-V81.zip) , or
- [John Smith Legacy](https://www.johnsmithlegacy.co.uk)

These will change the look of the game to match the experience we build for. Install by downloading the file and placing it in your "resource pack folder" (don't unzip). You can find your resource pack folder in-game via the options. Some Arbiters also suggest using the [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) optimization mod (optional).
