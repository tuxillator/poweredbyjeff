Our server is running version 1.7.5 of Minecraft. You can view the world in a realtime map using the ["map"](http://minecraft.poweredbyjeff.com) button at the top of the page.

## Client Setup

**In the Minecraft Launcher, edit your profile and set "Use version" = "Release 1.7.5".**

Server Name: Powered By Jeff
Server Address: minecraft.poweredbyjeff.com

Recommended texture packs for use on our server:
- [Life HD - v81 128x (download)](LIFE128x-V81.zip) , or
- [John Smith Legacy](https://www.johnsmithlegacy.co.uk)

These will change the look of the game to match the experience we build for. Install by downloading the file and placing it in your "resource pack folder" (don't unzip). You can find your resource pack folder in-game via the options. Some Arbiters also suggest using the [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) optimization mod (optional).

## General Information
There are 3 ranks on the server:
- Vagrants (no building): This is the rank of all visitors to our world. You can freely explore our constructions but will need to contact an Arbiter for promotion to Citizen if you wish to stay and modify the world.
- Citizens: Trusted regulars, have access to all shared resources and build power outside major cities.
- Arbiters: These folks are the moderators of the server, and designers of the core areas. Changes to server functionality is by agreement with a quorum of these people. Current Arbiters are:
 - Tuxillator
 - Sentrix141
 - GlennShade
 - Copats
 - Fudgious
 - Quara


We also have a Facebook group! Contact an Arbiter in-game for an invite.
