Earlier in the year I completed my PADI Rescue course. For those that enjoy diving more than once a year and are on the PADI bandwagon, I highly recommend completing this course. It makes you a safer and humbler diver, which if nothing else is what I see to be the most critical attributes to this sport.

Without further ado, here it is! If you're interested, the original PDFs are downloadable and printable when going to Tioman. Of course the usual disclaimer - please take out insurance, and I don't guarantee the accuracy/updatedness of this document. Be a real diver, do your own preparation and dive safe. Peace!
