Merry Christmas! And obviously a new website... hope you all like it! Ironically it's taken 12 years but I've gone full circle back to a static website (albeit using the powerful Hexo generator). Inspired by Node.js and it's ilk, along with lots of toying with MEAN stacks and Git at both work and play, this is now a change tracked Github CDN hosted website.

Either way - season's greetings :)
