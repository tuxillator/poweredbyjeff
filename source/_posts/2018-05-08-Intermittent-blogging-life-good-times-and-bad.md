It's been almost 3 years since I've posted on this blog! Disregarding some minor aesthetic fixes last November, this setup has remained relatively untouched and reliable over that time. A lot to be said for static site generation when your needs are simple - thanks Github and Hexo!

In that time much has happened in the world - one of the more exciting being SpaceX [landing reusable rockets vertically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANv5UfZsvZQ) (and then even [bigger ones simultaneously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0FZIwabctw), in science fiction fashion).

Anyway... for those of you not on social media or working at Apple I'm still alive :) peace!
