It's been a very busy start to 2015! But to keep the chops sharp I decided to try writing a few CanaryMod plugins. It took some effort to get a basic build environment going so I made a [tutorial for creating CanaryMod plugins using Eclipse](/canarymod-eclipse-tutorial/) out of my notes.

It's been about 12 years since I built anything serious in Java. I mean literally: [Java 1.4 was considered new](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history). Anyway it was fun and hopefully not too many errors. Cheers and enjoy!
